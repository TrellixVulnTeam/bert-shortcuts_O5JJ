This effect of DMHV is enhanced by co-transfection of cells with the tyrosine kinase PRTIG0 and the tyrosine phosphatase 1B. It is abolished when cells had been treated with PRTIG1, an inhibitor of PRTIG0 family tyrosine kinases. PROTPART1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of PROTPART0 within a region of amino acids 1-191 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and the yeast 2-hybrid system. Point mutation of both tyrosines 161 and 162 in the PROTPART0 protein abolishes the DMHV-effect on Ca2+ influx and tyrosine phosphorylation by PRTIG0. Single mutations of Y161 or Y162 shows that each of both tyrosines alone is sufficient for the DMHV-effect. We conclude that phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation of tyrosines in position 161 and 162 is essential for regulation of Ca2+ influx through PROTPART0 Ca2+ channels in HEK293 cells.",

Three methylated arginine residues, at Arg-240, Arg-650, and Arg-948, were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated the functionality of these arginine residues. The biological activity of PROTPART0 was suppressed by PROTPART1 (PROTPART1) due to PROTPART0 methylation, which reduced the recruitment of histone deacetylases to PROTPART0 and facilitated its nuclear export by enhancing interaction with PRTIG0. A constitutive negative (Arg\/Ala) mutant of PROTPART0 was resistant to the effect of PROTPART1, and a constitutive positive (Arg\/Phe) mutation mimicked the effect of arginine methylation. The biological activities of the wild type and the mutant proteins were examined in PROTPART0-null MEF cells. This study uncovered a novel means to inactivate, or suppress, PROTPART0, and demonstrated protein arginine methylation as a critical type of modification for corepressor.",

Upon stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines, PROTPART0 binds proteins that stimulate autophosphorylation within its activation loop and is thereby catalytically activated. This activation is transient; it peaks within a couple of minutes and is subsequently down-regulated rapidly to basal levels. The mechanism of down-regulation of PROTPART0 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that toxin inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases greatly enhances interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the PROTPART0 activation loop as well as the catalytic activity of PROTPART0. From proteomic analysis of PROTPART0-binding proteins, we identified PROTPART1 (PROTPART1), a type-2A phosphatase, and demonstrated that PROTPART1 associated with and inactivated PROTPART0 by dephosphorylation of Thr-187. Ectopic and endogenous PROTPART1 co-precipitated with PROTPART0, and expression of PROTPART1 reduced IL-1 activation of PROTPART0 but did not affect osmotic activation of PRTIG2, another PRTIG0. Reduction of PROTPART1 expression by small interfering RNA enhances IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-187 in PROTPART0. Enhancement occurred without change in levels of PRTIG1 showing specificity for PROTPART1. Our results demonstrate that PROTPART1 specifically down-regulates PROTPART0 through dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop, which is likely important for suppressing inflammatory responses via PROTPART0 signaling pathways.",

Although PROTPART0 can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in PROTPART1-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that PROTPART1 levels control the degree of PROTPART0 protein stabilization by affecting its Y\/S\/T-phospho content in CML cells. PROTPART1 physically interacts with PROTPART0, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate PROTPART0 at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho PROTPART0 binds to the PRTIG0 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a PROTPART1 antagonist, impairs the PROTPART0\/PRTIG3-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated PROTPART0, which presents an increased binding affinity for the PRTIG2\/PRTIG1 complex. Although PROTPART1 does not affect PRTIG1 autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on PROTPART0 Y phosphorylation, PRTIG2\/PRTIG1 binding to PROTPART0 and its subsequent S\/T phosphorylation. Silencing of PROTPART0 by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of PROTPART1(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib.

The tumour suppressor PROTPART0 (refs 4-7) is one of only a few non-histone proteins known to be regulated by lysine methylation. Here we report a lysine methyltransferase, PRTIG0, that methylates a previously unidentified site, Lys 370, in PROTPART0. This methylation site, in contrast to the known site Lys 372, is repressing to PROTPART0-mediated transcriptional regulation. PRTIG0 helps to maintain low concentrations of promoter-associated PROTPART0. We show that reducing PRTIG0 concentrations by short interfering RNA enhances PROTPART0-mediated apoptosis. We find that PROTPART1-mediated methylation of Lys 372 inhibits PRTIG0-mediated methylation of Lys 370, providing regulatory cross-talk between post-translational modifications. In addition, we show that the inhibitory effect of Lys 372 methylation on Lys 370 methylation is caused, in part, by blocking the interaction between PROTPART0 and PRTIG0. Thus, similar to histones, PROTPART0 is subject to both activating and repressing lysine methylation.

Here, we show that PRTIG0, which functions as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, associates with PROTPART1 in mammalian fibroblasts and catalyses sumoylation of PROTPART1. Sumoylation of PROTPART1 reduces its catalytic activity and inhibits the negative effect of PROTPART1 on PROTPART0 signalling and on transformation by the oncogene v-crk. Insulin-stimulated sumoylation of endogenous PROTPART1 results in a transient downregulation of the enzyme; this event does not occur when the endogenous enzyme is replaced with a sumoylation-resistant mutant of PROTPART1. These results suggest that sumoylation, which has been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus and nuclear pore, also modulates a key enzyme-substrate signalling complex that regulates metabolism and cell proliferation.",

In primary cells, inactivation of PROTPART0 prevents senescence and promotes oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, we show that PROTPART0 activates PROTPART1 by direct phosphorylation.
